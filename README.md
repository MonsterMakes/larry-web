## Description
***Update This*** Add the intent of your package here...

## Developer Setup

This project is leveraging the `@monstermakes/larry-identity-angular` library to provide authentication and authorization. Make sure to first copy `src/environment-details.json.template` to `src/environment-details.json` and provide proper values. Obviously this also requires the companion auth services running. 


### Developing @monstermakes/larry-identity-angular???
If you are working on the auth module you are going to need to first delete `node_modules/@monstermakes/larry-identity-angular` and then make sure the raw source version of `@monstermakes/larry-identity-angular` is in the same parent directory as this project and is named `larry-identity-angular`. Finally make sure you run `build-watch` in the `larry-identity-angular` project prior to running `npm start` in this project.
